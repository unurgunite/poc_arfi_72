# Proof of Concept for ARFI gem

This project is a demonstration of using ARFI gem

There is nothing to do in `master` branch. Go to `dynamic-database-use` branch to see how to use gem with several
databases at the same time or go to `single-database-use` to see how it works with just a single db instance (by default
project uses PostgreSQL).
